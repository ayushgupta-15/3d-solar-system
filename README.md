## 🌌 Planet Information

The solar system includes accurate representations of:

1. **Mercury** - Closest to the Sun, rocky and hot
2. **Venus** - Hottest planet due to greenhouse effect
3. **Earth** - Our home planet with blue color
4. **Mars** - The Red Planet with rusty appearance
5. **Jupiter** - Largest planet, gas giant
6. **Saturn** - Famous for its ring system (visually represented)
7. **Uranus** - Ice giant with blue-green color
8. **Neptune** - Farthest planet with deep blue color
